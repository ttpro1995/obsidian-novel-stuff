# Vampire

There is the virus give its victim similar characteristic of "vampire" in folklore. Although people called them "vampire", no one sure if it was really "vampire" as folklore mention. 


## Transmission

- Only human can become the carrier of virus.

- Saliva (low) and bloodstream (high) of the infected contain virus. 

- Inject virus into bloodstream 100% chance victim is infected, no matter the concentrate of virus, a single cell is enough to start the infection.

- Virus can infect on contact on body, depend on how thin the skin and level of virus concentration. If the skin of that point of contact is thick enough and no virus get into bloodstream, the victim is not infected.

- Level of virus in bloodstream determine the effect of virus on the infected.

Example of infection:

   - A victim being bite by the infected: virus from saliva mix with bloodstream, 100% chance of infection
   - A victim touch vampire blood with leather glove (he makes sure the blood does not touch his skin) 0% chance of infection
   - A victim touch vampire blood with bare hand, he has low risk of infection. 
   - A victim touch vampire blood with bare hand and taste the blood, 99% chance of infection


## Power and characteristic 

This section explain what the virus give victim.

### power
Not require train: 
- Strength
- Dexterity
- Endurance 
- All 5 sense 
- Immortality and not aging: They are not become older and die by old age. However, thay can be killed, starved to death, 
- Regeneration: Heal wound faster, however not immediately, can regrow lost limb given time. Blood clotted quickly to prevent blood lost. 
- Resilience: Hard to be killed, can survive a wound that should kill average human many time. Resist to most poison, disease, 

The power (Strength, Dexterity, Endurance) is never so-called superpower, however give an average vampire an edge over normal human in every life. A well trained person (as Van Helsing) or group of people can subdued an average vampire. 

However, a vampire which is trained to specialize use their power is deadly.


Must require train to use the power: 
- Magic <br>
For a normal person to be trained into a mage, wizard, he/she must inherited magic potential (i.e: magic potential is bond by genetics, decides on birth). However, all vampires have magic potential that can be trained into mage or wizard. 

### Infection level 

The infection level is how much virus in vampire body. The higher infection level, the stronger the vampirist ability. But the beast within also get stronger.

Starting infection level is decided by how the person is infected (bite, blood transfer, ...). 

Infection level increase gradually overtime. A vampire can manually increase infection level by comsuming, receiving blood from another vampire with higher infection level. 

Power scaling is a logarithmic functions. Therefore, there is a caping in vampire power.



### Diet

Prefer: blood of human (best), blood of mammal. <br>

Can eat any food ediable by normal human.

Vampires have high effiency in consumsing, digesting blood. However, blood is not required as vampire can survive and stay healthy on any food consume by normal people.

## Population control mechanism 
This section explain why the world is not filled with vampire. There is two control check. One prevent someone decide to turn themselves or their love one into vampires; another prevent someone raise a mass vampire army from common folk.


### Mortality rate
There are a chance that the infected will died in few hours BEFORE receive any vampirist power. Nobody have this knowledge unless they try, knowledge come with great cost of lives. 

Male: mortality rate is lower as older they are. Below age 10 is high (99%), At 12 and onward, mortality rate is at minimum, around 25%.

Female: Sure dead after 18. High (99%) for age below 5. Minimum at 10 to 14, at rate 30%.

<br/>

**(OOC) Purpose of the rule:**

- Make the idea of turning someone to vampire is risky, abuse vampire power for wound, disease healing (use Regeneration and Resilience), keeping VIP, love one stay alive (Immortality)
- Control the demographic of vampire: consist of mainly adult male, with small percentage of young (unmature, not breedable) female. 
- This control is lean more on random and chance than the person potential. 
- **Personal thought**: I don't want yet another Twilight clone, no more teen romantic.

### The beast within

 This happen after the infected passed "Mortality check" and gained vampirist power. 
 

 Worldbuilder note: The beast within is another check to prevent vampire population from spreading and overthrow human.
 
 Overview : The infected feels the urging sucking blood from living mammal, prefer human > living stock (cow, sheep, pig) > pest (rat,...). Most likely the victim will die or become infected themself. It is known that only human can become vampire.

<br/>

Symtom: 
+ The infected will thrist to drink blood from living mammal. 
+ Some said this is the thrist to hunt. 
+ Giving blood to the victim does not satisfy the thrist, and victim unlikely to take given blood when they are in unconscious, beast-like status. However, infected who are still conscious will trying to drink given blood, because human reasoning tell them blood might satisfy their thrist (in fact, it does not).

The only cure: The infect fight the beast within with his/her own willpower and discipline. The main point is that the infect her/him self must fight. But he/she does not have to do it alone. Others might provide spiritual support. 

**Who can help the infected**: 
+ Anyone can help, but prefer another vampire > family menber, best friend, brothers in arm > people with experience in psychology and vampirist study > anyone.
+ Requirement of helper: 
   - Helper must make emotional connection with the infected. Therefore, it prefer to be someone well-known to the infected, or helper have experience in psychology. It is also prefer a vampire as helper because the vampire has gone through the beast within of their own. 
   - Helper should be able to defend him/her/themselves when the infected temporary lost conscious and attack on instinct. 

**Outcome:** 
 + Success: The infected become human-vampire, who have vampirist power but restrain full of their humanity. 
 + Fail: The infected become feral vampire, act on instinct, hunt like predator, but prefer to prey on human and their living stock. Normally, they are lone wolf and don't form a pack. From now on, the infected cannot conquest the beast within and become human-vampire on their own. It required a/a group of helper. The longer the infected in this state, the difficulty the process become, until it is impossible (the infected have completely forgot all of their human memory). A group of trained knight can dispatch a feral vampire.

The fighting with the beast within is constant and prolong. But as the vampire overcome the beast, their humanity mentality become stronger. However, the higher the infection level, the stronger the beast within. Any attempt to increase infection level is risk fighting the beast within in uphill battle.


Difficulty to conquest The beast within: Most common folk will fail without assist, support from others. However, with helper, the most infected sucessfully conquest the beast within,  provided that the infected does not kill all the helper during the process or run away.

**(OOC) Purpose of the rule:**

- A natural selection to ensure every vampire who survive as a human is as tough as hell.
- Prevent a situation when someone, or some super-power/organization/government would create a massive vampire army. As most people will lose their mind, become feral beast.
- This control is lean on personal potential rather than pure luck.
