**Export Product**
There is a considerable [Ecclesiarchy](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Ecclesiarchy "Ecclesiarchy") presence on the planet; as a result of the significance of one of the major export products, and the weight of the [Imperial Cult](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Cult "Imperial Cult")'s beliefs with the populace. 

Incense aromatics are the principal export of Hilarion, almost all of which are used by the Ecclesiarchy throughout the [Calixis Sector](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Calixis_Sector "Calixis Sector").

The delicate nature of these fragrances, such as **frankincense** and **myrrh**, requires that the plants be harvested and processed manually -- otherwise the purity is lessened through mechanical contamination.

This factor is behind the very structure of the feudal society on Hilarion -- the peasants are the only viable means of managing this production.

Once this system was established it was a natural extension to include other fragrant plants and spices, which would benefit from such a hospitable environment and manual labour force, including **cinnamon** and **saffron**. These are rare commodities for trade, and their "hand-picked" nature increases their value on the interstellar market.

These ** small quantities of luxury goods** enable the noble houses to **maintain their status **and occasionally import **luxury items** in return, such as quality **fabrics** and **off-world tutors** for their children.

- The noble only export ** small quantities of luxury goods** (fragrances).
- Inport luxury consumer good and service. 

- Spices and incenses.

**Eco**
